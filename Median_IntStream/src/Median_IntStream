Given are some integers, which are read from the data stream. The task is to find the median of the integers read so far.

The median is the middle value of a sorted list of integers. If the size of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Input: [1, 2, 3,â€¦]
Output: [1, 1.5, 2..]
