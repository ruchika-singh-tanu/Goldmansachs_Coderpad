Given a binary string, that is it contains only 0s and 1s. We need to make this string a sequence of alternate characters by flipping some of the bits, our goal is to minimize the number of bits to be flipped.
Examples :

Input : str = “001”
Output : 1
Minimum number of flips required = 1
We can flip 1st bit from 0 to 1

Input : str = “0001010111”
Output : 2
Minimum number of flips required = 2
We can flip 2nd bit from 0 to 1 and 9th
bit from 1 to 0 to make alternate
string “0101010101”.
